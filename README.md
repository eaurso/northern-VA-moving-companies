# README

This is my second attempt at creating a rails project and it was much easier this time around. I am helping a local [Northern VA moving company](https://www.ablemoving.com/) and I'm confident that I can utilize Ruby on Rails to help this fantastic company. 

My experience with rails is nothing compared to my experience with local business owners improve their web presence. By learning new methods to help my customers, I stay on top of my competition. I also seem to know everyone who has a moving truck in the Northern Virginia area. That includes movers in the surrounding Arlington, Alexandria, and Fairfax areas.

However, I typically like building websites in either Weebly or Wordpress, but I saw the value that Ruby on Rails had to give. So here I am giving this site another chance. I'm mainly looking for Search Engine Optimization benefits and I think this will be an excellent test to find out just how effective it can be. I've been doing SEO for a long time and have ranked some incredible websites in areas I thought was near impossible. However, ranking Northern VA Movers has proved to be the hardest of them all.

## Northern Virginia Moving Company - What Does It Mean?

I've been working with a lot of local businesses in Northern VA over the past couple of years and I've helped generate a ton of leads so far. AdWords is by far one of the easiest way to get results for your clients, quick too! The great thing about AdWords is that it tells you if you're on the right track with your SEO efforts. When using AdWords, you get data on which keywords perform better than others. So, I've learned that the two most important keywords by far are [Moving Company Northern VA](https://www.ablemoving.com/) and Movers Northern VA.
